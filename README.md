# Trailblazer

Trailblazer is a route optimizer for tourists that is designed to help users find the most efficient order of travel based on the locations they would like to visit. The app will take into account several factors such as time, cost, transportation methods, and distance. In order to calculate the most efficient route while meeting the user's specific needs, we will be using Google Maps API. 

This project is interesting because it addresses a common problem: optimizing travel plans to save time and money while reducing stress. With the complexity of modern transportation networks, a smart tool to navigate these challenges can significantly enhance user convenience and efficiency. Additionally, if the user is unfamiliar with the destination country, our app can allow them to get the most out of their trip.

We chose this project due to its potential wide user base and impact on tourism. By integrating multiple transportation modes and user preferences, the project provides personalized efficient solutions. This project is justified as it involves algorithmic challenges (e.g., shortest path algorithms, travelling salesman problem), real-time data integration (transit schedules), and user interface design. This combination offers our team practical experience in software development, data analysis, and user experience design. Furthermore, unlike other travel apps such as Google Maps which force users to input their destinations in a set order, our project will optimize the order of middle destinations and provide users with the best route for their trip.

Trailblazer is well-suited to a mobile form factor for several reasons:
- Accessibility: Mobile devices allow for touch interface and notifications, thus making it easier for users to access the optimizer anytime and anywhere.
- Location Services: Mobile devices have GPS and location services that enhance the accuracy and relevance of route suggestions.
People always have their mobile devices handy and often use them for navigation when travelling. A mobile form factor enhances the functionality, convenience, and user experience of our route optimizer, thereby making it an essential tool for efficient travel planning.
